    Pythonâ€™s random module includes a function shuffle(data) that accepts
    a list of elements and randomly reorders the elements so that each possible
    order occurs with equal probability. The random module includes a
    more basic function randint(a, b)
    that returns a uniformly random integer from a to b
    (including both endpoints). Using only the randint function,
    implement your own version of the shuffle function.
